			<h1>Learning <a name='Psychology:learning notes'></a></h1>

			<p>
<i>Learning</i> is a relatively enduring change for behavior, resulting from experience.
</p>

<h5>Objective:</h5>

<br>

<pre>
- Defining what learning is?
- Identifying different learning processes?
- Describing nonassociative learning processes: habituation and sensitization.
</pre>

<h5>Classical learning</h5>

<br>

<p>
So, learning results from three different ways: * <i>Nonassociative learning</i> is when you respond to a certain stimulus or event after you've been repeatedly exposed(experienced it) to it. 1. <i>Habituation</i> is when you don't respond to a repeatedly happening stimulus or event; after a certain amount of time. * dishabituation is an increase in response because of a change happened in something familiar 2. <i>Sensitization</i> is when your response level increases to a repeated stimulus after exposure.<br>
<ul>
<li>Your blinking lamp starts to annoy after you've been <i>"habituated"</i> with it and decide to fix it. * You hear buzzing sound in the background and then you turn it out, or an alarm goes off and you notice it and see where it was!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li><i>Associative learning</i> is when you make connections between different things; you try to understand how stimuli or events are related.
<ul>
<li>You go to school, cause you want a degree of science.</li>
<li>You read a book, cause you try to obtain more vocabulary.</li>
<li>Dogs were tested in a libratory to associate their saliva with eating food. Pavlov observed that salivation would happen before the dogs even get the food; they associated a bowl or a man holding it with getting their next meal! In this case the man or bowl called <i>neutral stimuli</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Observational learning</i> is when you learn from watching others' behaviors.
<ul>
<li>You might learn from a person performing stand-comedy on YouTube</li>
<li>Or learn from your professor explaining what learning is!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Associative learning has various processes. Essentially two:
</p>

<p>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li>Unconditioned response and stimulus_(UR and US respectively)_</li>
</ol>
&gt; US is what causes the UR to happen for a particular animal; UR occurs without any prior training, such as a reflex
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>Breastfeeding a child would be the US for the their UR which is stop crying.</li>
</ul>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li>Conditioned response and stimulus_(CR and CS respectively)_</li>
</ol>
&gt; CS is a neutral stimulus that acts as the US after some trials, which then in turn causes the CR, i.e. similar as the original UR, but might not be as strong.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>Associating money with buying candy for a child which for most would result to happiness, money would be CS that produces CR.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Those processes have extensions and limits. <i>Second-order</i> conditioning which helps to understand the complexity of learned associations we create. In the example of the child above, assume each time the uncle comes, he gives money to the child to buy candy. The uncle now plays the role of a new CS associated with the old CS(money) to get CR(happiness). Moreover, a CS can be extinguished ones it's not associated with the US.
</p>

<p>
&gt; e.g. giving money to the kid, without buying him candy This process is called <b>extinction</b>.
</p>

<p>
Also the gradual formation of an association between a CS and an US is called <i>acquisition</i>.
</p>

<p>
&gt; In general the unconditioned response is stronger than the conditioned response.
</p>

<p>
Animals discriminate and generalize predictors based on certain stimuli. This helps to predict predators(i.e. potential danger) and to group new stimuli.
</p>

<p>
&gt; stimulus generalization: you conditioned a dog by 1000Hz tone, each time you present the tone, the dog produces a certain amount of saliva; then another amount is presented, say lower tone, then the dog will response with saliva(CR) for food(US). But after doing it a couple of times, the dog learns to discriminate between the strength of the tone, therefore will response to a certain amount of tone presented(e.g. initial one 1000)
</p>

<p>
A problem occurred with classical conditioning, proposed by Pavlov, that some CSs were more likely than others to produce learning. In addition, it's argued that biological preparedness plays an important role. It explains why animals tend to fear things more than objects that pose little threat.(i.e. fire and needle respectively)
</p>

<p>
&gt; Humans are more <i>taste averse</i> than sound or sight averse. However, some animals are far more likely sound or sight averse. E.g. a bird is sight averse, since this process influences his survival(i.e. eating or running away from predators)
</p>

<br>

<p>
----
</p>

<h4>Operant conditioning(OC)</h4>

<br>

<p>
<i>Goals</i>: - Defining OC - Differentiate between positive and negative reinforcement. - Differentiate between positive punishment and negative punishment - Identify biological cognitive factors that influence OC.
</p>

<p>
The main difference between operant conditioning and classical conditioning is that in OC an animal makes associations between events that it can control. In CC, on the other hand, associations are made between events that cannot be controlled.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in OC, the action's consequences determine the likelihood of that action being repeated.
</p>

<p>
<b>Law of effect</b>, as named by Thorndike, dictates that any behavior leads to a <i>satisfying state of affairs</i> is more likely to occur again. In contrast, any behavior leads to an <i>annoying state of affairs</i> is less likely to occur again.
</p>

<p>
However, the state of <i>satisfaction</i> isn't empirically observable, therefore Skinner came up with the idea of <b>reinforcement</b>. A <i>reinforcer</i> is a stimulus that occurs right after the response did, and it increases the likelihood that the response will re-occur/repeated.
</p>

<p>
Reinforcement's techniques: 1. <i>Shaping</i> a technique in which you reward(or reinforce) your subject any action that's close to the response you're expecting. Once first steps towards that behavior are met, you can reinforce more selectively. 2. <i>Scheduling</i> has two techniques in which reinforcement can be applied. Continues and partial reinforcement. * Continues technique leads to fast learning, but doesn't last for long * Partial technique is used a lot more in our daily lives. Some measurements should be accounted in order to reinforce. E.g. Fixed interval; on the same specified time reinforcement's given, Variable interval; on a variably interval proving reinforcement, ratio interval; proving reinforcement when a certain number of expected responses is met and variable schedule when reinforcement provided after an unpredictable amount of responses.<br>
&gt; Partial reinforcement leads to less extinction than continuous reinforcement; in in PR even if a reward wasn't given(for instance in a variable partial reinforcement schedule) the subject will still exhibit the expected behavior. &gt; Great example of crying babies; parents go to check on them variabally! which is pattern of partial reinforcement technique; they should =&gt; continuous reinforcement schedule!
</p>

<p>
There are many reinforcers, and most principals apply with the ones of classical conditioning. Such as generalization and discrimination. E.g. if Sheldon succeeded mutating Penny's behavior through chocolates, she will act accordingly using any other sweet stimulus. If your child tries throwing a tantrum and didn't get any reinforcers, he'll stop doing so eventually. <i>Primary reinforcer</i> is what's required for survival, i.e. food or water. It works better than any others; which makes sense, because we make actions directed by our biological needs. One other reinforcer is <i>secondary reinforcer</i> which is established through CC.
</p>

<p>
&gt; the presence of contingency while reinforcing is very crucial. Otherwise the wanted response won't be aligned with what you're expecting.
</p>

<p>
<b>Potency of reinforcement</b>: The more a subject willingly does a specific behavior associated with the reinforcer, and takes more time in it, the more the desired output you'll get. Of course, certain reinforcers work better than others; for each individual it's different. E.g. playing video games could be nicer than exercising for teenagers. Premack principal, however, dictates that more-valued activities can be used to reinforce the desire for less-valued activities. i.e. a parent could tell their children: if you exercised today, we can play video games together tonight!
</p>

<p>
<b>Positive and negative reinforcements</b> * PR: is when you add(reward with) something to the stimulus in order to increase the possibility a certain response to happen. Positive does not mean good; i.e. chocolate isn't necessarily good, but could be very strong stimulus. * NR: is when you remove something from the stimulus to reduce an unpleasant experience, event, response or thing. Negative does not mean bad; shutting your phone to focus on studying; your phone's on isn't bad, but helps your concentration level.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment. Reinforcements' techniques are for increasing the probabilities of certain responses to happen, punishment, on the other hand, decreases them.
