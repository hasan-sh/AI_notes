              <h2>Single-factor design</h2>

<br>

<p>
Where there is only one independent variable that researchers can manipulate.
</p>

<h2>Factorial designs</h2>

<br>

<p>
Factorial design is used by researchers when there's more than one independent variable.
</p>

<h3>Why factorial designs?</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Only experiment is made; which have different IVs. Rather than many experiment that have one IV in each.</li>
<li>Generalize the results; is the reaction time slower with and without the presence of a cell phone interaction while driving? Or does the effect of alcohol occur with and without power steering?</li>
<li>Information on interaction between factors(IVs); does the speed of reaction time depend on the presence of cell phones? Or does the effect of BAC depend on the presence of power steering?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Between-subject designs</h3>

<br>

<p>
In which each participant gets only one level of the independent variable; thus if you have 20 participants and got two levels, then you'll need to split the participants into 2 groups; 10 each.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Between-subject design can be used if there's a potential for order effects(practice or carryover). And when the IV has a permanent effect.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Advantages: no practice-effects; participants cannot get better at the next level of the IV, since they each group of them does only level(of the IV or among all IVs)</li>
<li>Disadvantage: groups might differ; thus matching or random assignment should be used to prevent that.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Within-groups designs</h3>

<br>

<p>
Are better than between-groups designs. That's because a within-group design gives the power to researchers, provides an opportunity for establishing covariance and temporal precedence(done by a repeated-measures design; which is a type of within-group design and it always gives repeated measures).
</p>

<p>
&gt; Within-groups designs only work if dependent variable isn't permanent. E.g. testing two methods of riding a bike for children, wouldn't be good with within-groups(for both types repeated/concurrent measures); since once a child learns with one method, testing the next method wouldn't be any good(practice-effects)
</p>

<h3>Threats to internal validity in within-group designs</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Order effect: a participant's engagement with an experiment might be affected by a condition they encountered before; this happens when exposure to one level of the independent variable influences the responses of the next level.</li>
</ul>
&gt; Order effect in within-group design is a confound variable; it might be caused not by the experimental manipulation, but rather by the sequence in which the conditions were experienced by the participants.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>Order effect includes <i>Practice effects</i> ; can occur when participants get a long sequence which might make them get better at the task, get tired or bored.</li>
<li>Order effect also includes <i>carryover effects</i> ; these effects might occur when participants' experience of the first condition(levels) contaminate the subsequent conditions(levels)</li>
</ul>
Since order effect is a potential internal validity problem, it can be avoided by:<br>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li><i>Counterbalancing</i> is how researchers present the levels of the independent variable to participants in different sequences; then order effects cancel out each other.</li>
</ul>
Counterbalancing can be made in dependency of how many conditions(levels) of the independent variable there are:<br>
<ul style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<li>Full counterbalancing; efficient for two or maximum three levels of the IV.</li>
</ul>
&gt; E.g. Suppose you go two groups of participants, and you're using within-groups design. To avoid any order effects, you counterbalance your group to your conditions A and B; then you expose A-&gt;B then B-&gt;A.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<li>Partial counterbalancing; can be used when researchers have a large set of levels in the independent variable; so some of the possible condition orders are represented; presenting the conditions to each participant in a randomized order(computers are very good at this)</li>
<li>latin-square can be used to simplify the process selection.</li>
</ul>
&gt; Note the selected groups that should be exposed to each sequence must be randomly selected.
</p>

<br>

<p>
An independent variable is usually used to find differences between groups. There could be however a difference in the differences of, which is beneficial to measure the effect of one manipulated variable on another. This is done by finding the interaction between the levels of the independent variables.
</p>

<p>
The interaction can help with questions posed like "depends on" or "when this happens, that changes .."
</p>

<p>
&gt; a <i>moderator</i> is a variable that changes the relationship of two variables. In factorial design, however, a moderator is an independent variable that changes the relationship between <i>another</i> independent variable and a dependent variable. E.g. does age(IV) moderate the effect of phone cell use on breaking onset time(reaction time)? -&gt; it doesn't according to research.
</p>

<h3>Main effects and interactions</h3>

<br>

<p>
In factorial design of two independent variables, a main effect is about asking <i>is there an overall difference between the two independent variables?</i>
</p>

<p>
&gt; The term <i>main effects</i> might be misleading that it's the most important piece when testing with factorial design. However, it's not. It's better being looked at as <i>overall effects</i> among the two independent variables.
</p>

<p>
Main effects find the difference that affects the dependent variable and could occur in one independent variable. Main effects then average the results from the other levels of the other independent variable and see if it's a statistically significant main effect.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Interaction can occur independently if there's main effect or not!
</p>

<p>
&gt; In real-life experiment, there might be no difference among groups, although you get a difference in main effects and it's significantly different! In such a case, statistical report should be done in order to compare the found average difference(main effect) with each result in each group.
</p>

<p>
Interactions in a research can be calculated from its results on the dependent variable. Ways to calculate interactions:
</p>

<p>
&gt; Interaction effect is symmetrical; row1-row2 or row2-row1 = difference in differences(interaction) Interaction answers the question of: is there interaction between A and B. - subtracting a level of the IV from the other. The same on the other IV's levels. Then the numbers will indicate whether there's interaction or not. - previous method works on both, row1 - row2(for the 2 IVs) or row2 - row1. Or even col1 - col2. - Interactions can also be read out of a chart bar or a graph based on if the lines are parallel(there's no interaction) or nonparallel(there's interaction). In a chart bar, you can connect the different bars' tops with each other and check the created lines. In a graph see if the two different lines are or not parallel.
