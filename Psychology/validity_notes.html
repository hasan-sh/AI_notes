              <h3>Basic knowledge</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Independent variable: usaualy done by researchers to manipulate the result</li>
<li>control variable: constant; by which a researcher can manipulate the process(e.g. Stroop effect: number of words provided to participant; it stays the same)</li>
<li>confounding variables: the varieties by which different variables are presented( the order of the natural, incongruent and congruent variety)</li>
</ul>
&gt; confound variables are tricky to be checked, and should usually be avoided by researchers for a research to be successful
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Anxiety as a variable of interest: attention of ppl would vary in dependency of emotions, e.g. in Stroop effect: participant would take longer with incongruent variety(red; presented in blue, etc), because they're focusing on the words, not the colors; since they aren't congruent!</li>
<li>conceptual variable(construct):
<ul>
<li>states at an abstract level</li>
<li>e.g. anxiety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>operational variable(operational definition): theoretical variable can be operationalized in different ways
<ul>
<li>specific ways in which a construct is manipulated or measured!</li>
<li>e.g. test score-&gt;control or anxiety group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>THree claims:</h5>

<br>

<pre>
- frequency claim:
- association claim: focuses on the relationship between two variables 
    - single people eat fewer vegetables(the variable here is 'single people')

- causal claim: focuses on a change in one variable is responsible for  changing the value of another variable -&gt; experimental research
    - e.g. music lessons enhance IQ
</pre>

<h3>construct validity</h3>

<br>

<p>
&gt; refers to how well study's variables are measured or manipulated. e.g. what is the influence of familiarity on attractiveness? people tend to like what they already know!
</p>

<p>
constructs: familiarity - attractiveness operational variables: orientation - score
</p>

<p>
Threats to construct validity: - inadequate operational definition - e.g. suppose u got a test, applied to ppl in prison, to know if it's save they could be released? think about: is it about if they could be released or not, or about whether the prisoners <i>wish</i> to be released? - mono-operation bias - e.g. study investigating mental workload;
</p>

<h3>external validity</h3>

<br>

<p>
Indicates how well the results of a study generalize to, or present, individuals, settings places, and times besides those in the study itself can a study generalize?
</p>

<p>
&gt; observation is done to generalize to a certain population
</p>

<p>
threats to external validity: - selection biases; e.g. effect of marijuana, you'd select ppl who smoke it, not anyone u see in the street! so it's subjective! - study getting is different from other settings: - e.g. study on attitudes towards drug users: results vary very much; - location(place) - time: e.g. attitude about ppl eating meat, could vary if it's done without giving context(old time), while with more knowledge results would vary from the previous!
</p>

<h3>internal validity</h3>

<br>

<p>
the possibility to draw causal conclusions
</p>

<p>
&gt; Can we rule out alternative explanations?
</p>

<p>
Threats to internal validity: - <b>maturation</b>: measuring ability of math level for students(children): at age 8 u provide a test, and after a certain time another test, they might do better(they;re called the experimental group) however that's not accurate, and could be manipulated by different variables. So using a control group; who never did the test and see the result if match;
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li><b>testing</b>: e.g. special methods was provided between the tests, to decide these methods were better, is it required to have another group to compare! The increase might not be caused by the intervention, but by taking the test twice; i.e. <i>practicing more</i>!</li>
<li><b>instrumentation</b>: e..g in between the tests, there could be some students on diet on weight. U need to keep that in mind, because it may account for the results</li>
<li><b>regression to the mean</b>: e.g. study of a new learning method in low- and medium-ranking pupils:</li>
</ul>
&gt; throwing dices: two groups, one higher numbers one lower, what would u think if the group that has the lowest, and redo them; ppl would expect to get higher than the other group! this is known as regression to the mean.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>experimental mortality</li>
<li>selection effects: e.g. simpson paradox: know the effect of a pill to cure a patiet from a headach 40ppl received the pill, 40 didn't: 20 didn't have headache 16 did. 50% of who took it cured, 40% of who didn't, didn't cure.</li>
</ul>
&gt; mrn snf women, took it. 30 took it, 10 women didn't. 60% of women cured, 70% of men cured. Now 10men didn't take it 30 women did. and 20%of women cured, and 30% of men cured. WE can conclude that men cured either way. So the effectiveness of the pill is subjected to how many women or men participated!
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>observer bias: done by the research; to investigate</li>
<li>demand characteristics: is when participants change their behavior once they learn, by observation perhaps, how they should interact in accordance to their role; how researcher expected them to behave. E.g. hawthorn effect; when individuals change aspects of their behaviors once they notice they're being observered.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>statistical validity</h3>

<br>

<p>
&gt; (STUDY IT AT HOME)
</p>

<p>
HOw well do the number in the study support the claim?
