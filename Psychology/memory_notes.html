              <p>
Memory is the nervous system's capacity to retain and retrieve skills and knowledge; is an active process that requires attention * The information individuals retrieve can be altered by the process of recollections. * Memory doesn't work like a digital camera; thus it's not completely reliable on what information it contains.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple memory systems, each of which differs in its process.
</p>

<p>
Memory has three main phases: * encoding: processing/preparing information that should be stored. * Short-term memory: * limited capacity: * memory span task: magic number =&gt; 7 * 7 relates to individual items * by recoding(chunks) =&gt; may increase the capacity of STM, thus expansion of capacity * Long-term memory: unlimited capacity. * items disappear as a result of decay and replacement &gt; Recency effect represent the retrieval from STM; you most likely to remember the most last thing you might hear from a sequence. &gt; Primacy effect represent the retrieval from LTM; by rehearsal the terms in the sequence might be stored in the LTM, so you would be able to retrieve them(and if the interval of representing this sequence of terms; could help consolidating them in LTM)
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Rehearsal: STM =&gt; LTM; reconsolidation can happen hereafter, which might alter the memory retrieved in some way.


Hos is info transferred from working memory to LTM:
* Depth of processing
    * shallow processing(surface form)
    * deep processing(meaning)
    &gt; e.g. 48 words were presented to a group to extract meaning, the group whose depth of processing was deep processing did better.

* understanding is also important in order to transfer info from working memory to LTM.
    * schema is a cognitive structure that helps understand and perceive information; if a story presented with a schema, you understand it better than hearing it without a schema.

<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>storage: when storing the memory in a part of the brain that's aligned with its sensory input(e.g. you hear a piece of music, it gets consolidated in the part responsible for auditory)</li>
</ul>
<i>Long-term</i> potentiation: is making the synaptic connections more potent, or making the postsynaptic neurons more easily/likely activated in response of the stimulation done by the pre-synaptic neurons.<br>
&gt; One requirement for it is the NMDA receptor; NMDA opens only if a nearby neuron Ô¨Åres at the same time
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>explicit memory: requires conscious effort
<ul>
<li>episodic memory: individual memory(e.g. what you had for breakfast)</li>
<li>semantic memory: facts and knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>implicit memory: doesn't require conscious effort</li>
</ul>
&gt; Amnesia a deficit in LTM resulting from disease, brain injury or psychological trauma; one loses the ability to retrieve vast quantities of info.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>retrieval: getting memories back; when needed. These retrieved memories would most likely not be 100% the same as the ones stored.
<ul>
<li>retrieval cues: a stimulus that helps you retrieving memories.
<ul>
<li>if the context during recall is similar during learning, you can better retrieve memories during retrieval phase.</li>
<li>the state of mind with which you store the information is an important for recalling information</li>
<li>the richer encoding context(i.e. when you learn the info; refers to understanding or deep processing), the better recall.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>Reconsolidation</i>: is the process of retrieving memories and storing them again in another form.
</p>

<p>
&gt; I.e. once memories are activated, they need to be consolidated again to be stored back in memory.
</p>

<h2>When memory fails:</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>an inability to remember:
<ul>
<li>absentmindedness: inattentive or shallow encoding of events: when you encode info in a shallow way you might not remember afterwards.(e.g. you met someone but attended to his appearance rather than their name, you most likely forgot their name!)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; we all suffer from this, because in our daily lives we're not aware of all thoughts and behaviors we employ.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>memory decay: forgetting over time; we are living organisms(we are changing, so are our memories)
<ul>
<li>why do we forget after time?
<ul>
<li>caused by metabolic processes</li>
<li>interference
<ul>
<li>we forget less after we sleep, than after wakefulness</li>
<li>proactive interference: when old information inhibit remembering new information.</li>
<li>retroactive interference: when new information inhibit remembering old information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>memory reconstructions(distortions of memory) memories are changed over time consistent with current beliefs or attitudes; so people, when retrieving, tend to be biased.</li>
</ul>
&gt; memories change because people talk about it, and when retrieving they become reconsolidated, thus they embellish(changed, decorated)
</p>

<br>

<p>
<i>suggestibility</i>: the development of biased memories from misleading information * different words/sentences might lead to different result in responding to them * memories can be distorted or even implanted; if you're convincing, you can implant memories that never happened.
</p>

<p>
&gt; repressed memories can lead to disastrous results; like accusing someone in doing sth, after you go to a therapist.
