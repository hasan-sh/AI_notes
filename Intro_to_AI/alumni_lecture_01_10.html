              <h2>Yara</h2>

<br>

<p>
Graduated 9ys ago and now works at the dutch central bank. Started as a software developer(in a consultancy) <i>What benefits she got from AI:</i> - diversity of the program - worldwide dependency on it; acquired at the vu - gained different perspectives on how to tackle problems and work in a multi-disciplinary env.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Academic network helps the best; for finding jobs and applying your knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Yara is lost and doesn't know what todo next..;)

<h2>Making chatbots behave | Floris den Hengst</h2>

<br>

<p>
About Floris: he did bachelor and master at the VU. Leared machine learning and data mining. One interesting project, he says, was sudoku. Where they solved it within seconds.
</p>

<p>
&gt; What part of ai did play in sudoku? symbolic ai / KNowledge &amp; reasoning; are important
</p>

<p>
Started a startup in which they used data mining techniques; and some small application forecasting in the company env.
</p>

<p>
&gt; FLoris too didn't know why he chose ai, but he was interested in it.
</p>

<p>
PHD: he's doing CS and reading tons of papers; then he designs
</p>

<p>
And currently he's working on a chatbot based on analysis to teach it how to respond; many programming involved
</p>

<p>
&gt; Would ur chatbot understand almost everything? Or is it just questionnaire oriented? it interprets most inputs from the user; i.e. audio and text
</p>

<p>
U talk with the chatbot in different ways; e.g. audio or text. - they convert audio into text to be understood; it has different state based on the convo - the bot then should respond with certain values; based on the question provided! - if the respond is audio, the bot converts its legible text to audio again.
</p>

<p>
Pattern: Reinvorcement learning is used in the chatbot development. - agent(chatbot) observes the env - sets a state based on the input - gets a reward from users; can be a number that the agent obtains - generates new state
</p>

<p>
Neural networks(deep reinforcement learning): was thought to work best with chatbots! in chatbot this creates lots of problems: - it can be pushed in certain ways; which could be unethical and specially unpredictable
</p>

<p>
&gt; so it's hard to obtain and Floris is working on that!
</p>

<h3>Romy</h3>

<br>

<p>
WOrks for TNO; innovation for life Research oriented in many areas: - health - security - Romy.
</p>

<p>
The focus is to improve the performance of ppl and teams in complex demanding envs.
</p>

<p>
<i>Projects:</i> - personalized learning: learning will become more effective and attractive when learning materials and learning env are designed to fit your personal needs. - a game (space fortress) enables them to make research based on personalized learning; many factors make it hard
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>fit for purpose realism: AIMS: ai for military simulations; simulation based</li>
<li>Human - AI collaboration: to perform a task together they should learn and understand each other
<ul>
<li>mental models: humans: have self awareness and theory of mind and what the ai thinks about us. AI should have the same as humans</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; if these steps aren't aligned: then something will defo go wrong.
</p>
