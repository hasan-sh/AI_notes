              <h3>Correlational research</h3>

<br>

<p>
&gt; it leads to association claims e.g. pl who often watch violence on tv are more violent than others; it doesn't have to be true, but it still is a claim.
</p>

<p>
<b>Correlation Coefficient(r)</b> - a measure that describes two things and an indication of the degree of linear relation between them. - Varies between -1 and +1; 1 or close to it means your research - absolute value indicates the strength of the relation - sign indicates the direction of the relation
</p>

<p>
<b>scatter diagram</b>: a representation of the correlation research
</p>

<p>
&gt; interesting about correlation is that knowing one variable allows you to predict the other; e.g. person didn't sleep well/enough, they might get bad results on the test
</p>

<p>
<b>Statistical validity(of these claims)</b>: do the data support the claims that are made? - what is the strength of the correlation(effect size)? &gt; a strong correlation allows making more accurate predictions.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>to what extent the correlation measured is affected by the outliers:
<ul>
<li>outlier is an observation with an extreme score in either of the variables</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; effect of the outlier depends on the sample size; number of observation. An outlier can have a very large effect, the smaller the samples size is.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>is the correlation statistically significant?</li>
</ul>
&gt; in research your interested in a population you want to generalize to.
</p>

<br>

<h5>examples</h5>

<br>

<p>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li>A positive correlation exists between hours ppl do sport and general health:</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>what does this mean/imply? is it:
<ul>
<li>sports =&gt; health</li>
<li>health =&gt; sports</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; There is an unknown direction between the correlation
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li>n of ppl drown p/m and ice creams sold p/m</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>what does this mean/imply? is it:
<ul>
<li>ice creams =&gt; drowning</li>
<li>drowning =&gt; ice creams</li>
<li>most likely: <i>high temperature</i> =&gt; most ice creams and drowning</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; 3rd variable problem
</p>

<br>

<p>
The strength of a correlation indicates associations, but doesn't provide the causality. - directionality problem - 3rd variable problem
</p>

<h5>Criteria to establish causation</h5>

<br>

<p>
&gt; doesn't match means no causation - which direction of both variables in which they're related; matches - the temporal difference; doesn't match - is there a 3rd variable associated with the variables with which you calcuate the correlation; if there is a 3rd variable, then it doesn't match - establish internal validity on the basis of correlation research. How?
</p>

<pre>
    &gt; researchers assume there's no 3rd variable
    - by separating the participants into subgroups on the basis of a reasonable 3rd variable
    &gt; e..g well being correlates to the number of substantive conversations. Suppose now that well educated ppl are more likely to have higher scores on well being measures, and less educated ppl are less likely. Now the 3rd variable that plays is Education, so there's no direct direction between well-being and n of conversations since the influence of Education on the scores(only if education results into positive correlation)
</pre>

<p>
<i>Cross-lagged-panel procedure</i>: gives you the direction of the variables(i.e. which affects the other)
</p>

<p>
IF the correlation is zero: - restriction of range - non-linear relationship - no association
</p>

<h3>the basics of experimenting</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>experiment occurs when a particular comparison is produced when other while other aspects of the situation are held constant.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Experimental research</h3>

<br>

<p>
An experiment is important to discover causal claim. Unlike correlational research, experimental research is the only way to investigate causal issues.
</p>

<p>
In any research there are important variables that could elicit or support the claim.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li><b>Manipulated variable</b> is a controlled variable; that researchers can change; such as assigning participants to a particular level(value) ~ ResearchMethods-276</li>
<li><b>Measured variable</b> is the record of the means that the researchers observe. After manipulating the controlled variable, researchers would look at sef-reports, behavioral observations or physiological measures in order to record a difference.</li>
<li><b>Independent variable</b> is the manipulated variable. From the perspective of a researcher, the independent variable is a variable that the researcher is able to manipulate in trial to obtain(observe the dependent/measured variable) similar or different results.</li>
<li><b>Dependent variable</b> is the measured variable. That a researcher has no control over and can only be observed by the researcher.</li>
<li><b>Control variables</b> are any <i>constant</i> that's held by researchers. In other words, a CV is one or more independent variable that's not manipulated by researcher; CVs allow researchers to separate potential cause from another and thus eliminate alternative explanations for results.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When an experiment yields results that don't go with the reality(original claim), then this research finds <i>null results</i> - Null results; there can be different explanation. Maybe: - independent variable didn't affect the dependent variable - manipulation was too weak; e.g. 1 week of training might have been too short - insensitive measures; - ceiling effect: e.g. reading test might have been too easy - floor effect: e.g. reading test might have been too hard - unreliable measurements; - type 2 error: not enough power(small n)
</p>

<p>
&gt; while manipulating the independent variable, u should account to any may occur confound variable. Confound variables, however, differ in the way you interpret them, which causes variabilities. Systematic or unsystematic variability. e.g. in the pasta experiment, if the attitude of assistants could be a confound variable. However, that's the case only if it was systematically variable. That is the assistants were generous for the medium-bowel group and reserved with the large-bowel one. If not, then it's a unsystematic variability(random) across both groups and their attitude wouldn't be confound and thus it's not a design confound.
</p>

<p>
How can u make a distinction in an experimental research: - Between-subjects design(independent-groups design); separate groups of subjects receive different levels of the independent variable. - within-subjects design(within-groups design): each subject receives all levels of the independent variable.
