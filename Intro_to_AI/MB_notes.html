<i>Guest Martin Brikering</i> works at institute for sound and vision(NISV)
</p>

<p>
&gt; target of audiences(see slides)
</p>

<p>
NISV is a museum where they present and provide their data. And has extensive archive in storage.
</p>

<p>
&gt; archives aren't produced by them but collected E.g - radio an tv - documentary film - newsreels - home movies! - web video; - video games;
</p>

<p>
THey got 18tb. Tapes are stored in locks nad robot arms deliver certain tapes that was requested; old-scholl way no other way?!
</p>

<p>
Digital services: - public website: - ppl can search through catalogue and find relevant materials. - footage library for pros: they get subscriptions to order them more easily. - educational platform - research platform
</p>

<p>
Research topics - sustainability: preserving the data and maintain the archive - metadata: describing the collections so that ithey stay accessible - access: how ppl want to consume the data and considering the possible or available provider(product) - digital humanities: to do research on much larger collections of data; for different researchers - users: to know your users.
</p>

<p>
Challenges: - retrieve fragments from the archive based on queries from the users; - Gather the needed data that helps retrieving fragments. This is done by using other data; metadata
</p>

<h3>Case1</h3>

<br>

<p>
<i>Metadata enrichment</i>: challenging because of the limited resources; since they are public oriented(not commercial)
</p>

<p>
&gt; Manual annotation was done; which is not efficient.
</p>

<p>
Annotation: machine analysis used to describe the material and improve the existing ones. - speakers labelling - image recognition; for them it's still in evaluation phases.
</p>

<p>
A new way of looking at AUdio, video data extraction; hard due to storage size As an alternative they created a game in which people had to watch the game and write a description of what you're seeing in the screen; a reward is points then to get certain collection; e.g. dvd set
</p>

<p>
OpenIMages's been used by several organizations; wikimedia uses this open api as well!
</p>

<p>
&gt; SO this data collections can be used and integrated through different ppl or providers.
</p>

<p>
NISV watned to link wikidata repo into their own data collections to enrich them; useful because wiki data's got a huge set of data. SO, they don't have to collect data that would otherwise have cost a lot of effort; saving resources.
</p>

<p>
&gt; copyright revents them from collecting data from the right holders, and that's difficult to gain.
</p>

<p>
Development of their new media museum: tells the story of the medai landscape; and the history of radio and television. And they're also looking into how tech can help getting more visitors and make it woth form them! The challegne here is identifying the visitors: currently they're using tags for users to be identified.
</p>

<p>
&gt; ANd now they're researching whether hey could embrace facial recognition technology and whether it is reliable. THey used software already exists in the market. Then they built on that and made it possible to ppl to be: - identified - entrolled - greeted and seeing visual feedback.
</p>

<p>
Is it reliable?
</p>

<p>
&gt; it wouldn't be possible to implement in museums; due to that ppl aren't easily identified!
</p>

<h2>REsults for this system(factial recognition)</h2>

<p>
Q:
</p>

<p>
```
</p>

<p>
weighted_edges = [ ("A", "B", 2), ("A", "C", 3), ("A", "D", 4), ("B", "C", 1), ("B", "F", 7), ("C", "A", 3), ("C", "B", 2), ("C", "F", 6), ("D", "E", 8), ("E", "D", 7), ("E", "F", 4), ("F", "B", 6), ("F", "C", 6),]
</p>

<p>
G = Graph(weighted_edges, weighted=True, directed=True) G.show()
</p>
