              <h3>Measurement scales</h3>

<br>

<p>
Research can be measured by providing two definitions; of the <i>conceptual</i> and <i>operational</i> variables.
</p>

<p>
The levels of operational variables can be coded using different scales(<b>measurement scales</b>):
</p>

<p>
&gt; 3 types of quantitative variables: - categorical(or Nominal) scale: consists of names or numbers - Ordinal scale: ranked order(e.g. order of best movies); where only the orders matter - interval scale: on an equal interval(e.g. distance or weight); cannot be zero - Ratio scale: can be zero(e.g. scores in exams or numbers of ratings)
</p>

<pre>
&gt; measurement scales are important for:
- determining the possible statistical operations
- determining the possible conclusions
</pre>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>categorical(or Nominal) variables: coded with meaningful names or not meaningful numbers; numbers don't reflect what the meaning of the subjects is. (e.g. sex)</li>
<li>quantitative variables: coded with meaningful numbers. (e.g. height or weight)</li>
<li><b>Conceptual</b> variable: is the subject of the research; on a theoretical level.</li>
<li><b>Operational</b> variable: is the means with which different techniques can be proposed to approach the conceptual variable
<ul>
<li>self-report: in which participants rate/choose what suits them the best</li>
<li>operational report:</li>
<li>psychological report:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; The levels of operational variables can be coded using different scales
</p>

<br>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<br>

<p>
Before choosing which measures to use in a study, researchers examine data, collected by them or others, to decide whether it's reliable or not.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Establishing the reliability of a measure is an empirical question.
</p>

<p>
&gt; the variability in the process u obtain from the reliability assessment gives an indication of whether the measurement are reliable or not.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>observed score = true score + error + score</li>
<li>true score: the real value</li>
<li>error score: the difference between the measured value and the real value which is affected by
<ul>
<li>the test(situation)</li>
<li>the person</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
&gt; If an operationalization is reliable, it will yield a consistent pattern of scores every time.
</p>

<h3>Assessments(types) of reliability</h3>

<br>

<p>
&gt; depending on how a variable was operationalized. - test-retest reliability: to get consistent scores over time(i.e. doing a measure by a researcher, yields consistent results for hem or her)
</p>

<pre>
&gt;  information of the extent to which the test is capable of
</pre>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>interrater reliability: consistent scores must be obtained independency of who measured the variable</li>
</ul>
&gt; is most relevant for observational measures
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>internal reliability: consistent pattern of answers must be obtained by a participant, no matter who the researcher's phrased the question; this applies only to <i>self-report</i> scales</li>
</ul>
&gt; e.g. Diener's five-item subjective well-being scale; participants should always disagree or agree on all 5 questions; then we can say the scale has internal reliability
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>experimental reliability: in replicating research that has been done before, the reliability rate would be higher if the result will be equal or very similar</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to analyse data and see whether it's reliable.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Reliability quantification
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Scatterplot: a good picture of a plane where u show the agreement of the data, based on test-retest or interrater reliability</li>
<li>Correlation coefficient r: provides the direction and the strength of the association between the two variables; no matter what scale was used.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Descriptive research</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Observational research: in which u look at behavior; people animals or events. ANd you record whats happening
<ul>
<li>to describe nature; e.g. evolution theory</li>
<li>to generate hypotheses(not to test hypotheses!; for this you should do a control experiment)
<ul>
<li>e.g. bystander effect; the more ppl there are, the more likely those ppl will help ppl in emergency situations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; this hypotheses isn't true in all cases, there are many factors that play in and it differs from one person to another.
</p>

<h5>Problems:</h5>

<br>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<li>people are not always good at observation</li>
<li>low internal validity; hard to obtain any casual conclusions</li>
<li>threats construct validity; do you measure what you measure!
<ul>
<li>Observer bias; ppl could have make assumptions based on their experiences</li>
<li>Observer effects; result might come in prefer of the expectation of the observer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; e.g. horse was trained to do somemath, but he awas responding to the trainer
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 120pt'>
<li>Reactivity: ppl change behavior when they know they're been observed
<ul>
<li>unobtrusive observations</li>
<li>wait it out strategy(participant observation)</li>
<li>unobtrusive measures</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>survey research: a method of possing gquestions to people on telephone, in person or interview.</li>
</ul>
&gt; u should
</p>

<br>

<h5>problems</h5>

<br>

<pre>
- Low internal validity; u don't know what hte cause of the answer was!
- threats to construct validity
    - question wording; some words might change the participant's opinion, and therefore the answer they give.
        - double-barreled question: do yu enjoy swimming and wearing sunscreen?
        - negatively worded question; ppl who don't drive with a suspended license should never be punished
        - question order
    - the use of response sets(e.g. )
        &gt; to avoid it: phrase questions differently, so ppl cannot respond by a specific pattern(yes, yes, no, no)
    - Trying to look good or bad(faking good or bad)
    - ppl aren't always capable of reporting accurately about their feelings.
</pre>

<p>
Descriptive research leads to frequency claims - Three in four women worldwide rate their lives as <i>struggling</i> or <i>suffering</i>; this conclusion isn't representative for all the women in the world, cuz the ones did the research are far less than the actual number.
</p>

<h5>problems</h5>

<br>

<pre>
- threats to external validity
    - biased or unpresentative sample
        - self-selction: participants of a study are free to decide whether or not they want to take a part in the study; e.g. sexual behavior in humans, ppl participated they were willing to share their sexual behavior, so it's not representetive sample.
        &gt; to obtain a representative sample 
            - random sample; different ppl in a study must be chosen
            - different rewards; 
            - replication; replicate ur result
- Threats to statistical validity
    - number of samples are small
</pre>

<p>
&gt; important to question how well - each variable was measured
