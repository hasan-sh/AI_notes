              <h3>Thinking</h3>

<br>

<p>
We rely on making decision. We do that all the time. Decision making based on selecting the best alternative from among several options.
</p>

<p>
Two types of representations: - analogical: forms, maps or appearances - dissimilar from pictures; AR automatically interprets images from the real one - symbolic: numbers or names - it resembles a map of related data(e.g. words, [(red, orange), (apple, cherry)]) &gt; The closer these relations are, the more likely the SR will trigger and make connections base on them.
</p>

<p>
Theories that are important for Decision making
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Normative theory: people choose options that will provide the greatest gain</li>
</ul>
&gt; people don't always follow this rule; even if the outcome is clear and rational
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>values of the alternative options</li>
<li>the probabilities associated with the alternative options</li>
</ul>
&gt; e.g. a lottery ticket costs 10 dollars and p(winning 1,000,000)
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<li>EV(buying) = (1*10dollars) + (10<tt>**</tt>-6 * 1,000,000) = 9</li>
<li>EV(not buying) = (1<i>0dollar) + (0 </i> 1,000,000) = 0; the rational choice.</li>
</ul>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Descriptive theory: tries to realistically account for the variability, such as biases and irrationality in how people decide.</li>
<li>Heuristics(mental shortcuts): ppl rely on this theory when certain decisions require some sort of calculations. There are several common ones:</li>
</ul>
&gt; it happens unconsciously and quickly. Heuristics are ofter adaptive
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>relative comparisons:
<ul>
<li>anchoring: the tendency to judge relying on the first piece of information encountered or information that comes most quickly to mind;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
&gt; e.g. you buy a washing machine. The first one you see is 800 bucks and the second one is 600; you most likely to buy the second, since you'd think you've bough the cheaper one! Whereas if it was the other way around you may or may not buy the first one(assuming the 1st is 400 and 2nd 600)
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<li>framing: the tendency to emphasize the potential losses and gains from at least one alternative;</li>
</ul>
&gt; people categorize words related to losses as aversive; phrasing the question and alternatives can alter responses of ppl.
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>Availability: based on what's available(known) to people; knowledge that are most easily come to mind</li>
<li>Representative: the tendency to make judgments based on what's known by the majority.</li>
<li>Affective: measuring each choice one would make and its outcome and how it affects individuals</li>
</ul>
&gt; ppl overestimate how events will make them feel in the future
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>The paradox of choice: when too many options are available, especially when all of them are attractive and you need/desire; the more choices you got, the less choices you'll choose!</li>
</ul>
&gt; better way than overthinking of the alternatives and different choices/options, you're most likely to end up with a choice that'll make you unhappy; to avoid that, choose to be a satisfier with your choices.
</p>

<p>
<i>Problem Solving</i>: is finding a solution for a problem to reach a goal. It can be improved by:
</p>

<pre>
* breaking problems into *subgoals*:

* restructuring the problem: 

* working backward from the goal:

transferring an effective strategy from an analogous situation: 
</pre>

<p>
Obstacles to problem solving:
</p>

<p>
&gt; Two things that inhibit problem solving are:
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>complexity: something you cannot fix; find it difficult</li>
<li>mental sets: where ppl are inclined to proceed in one direction and not another; which could lead to not being able to solve a problem
<ul>
<li>functional fixedness: fixed ideas about the typical functions of objects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Overcoming obstacles to solutions:
</p>

<pre>
- understanding =&gt;  subgoals; so you make problems easier to solve.
- restructuring =&gt; a new way to thinking about the problem; best way when a metal set is preventing u from solving a problem.
- use an algorithm =&gt; should i explain this?!!!
- Use an analogy =&gt; 
- Wait for a sudden insight =&gt; a solution might just occur suddenly 
</pre>

<h3>Language</h3>

<br>

<p>
Language is a system of communicating using sounds and symbols. The hierarchical structure of this system helps our brains with analyzing and understanding language. That is, breaking sentences into multiple words and words into sounds; each letter. Each word can have one or more <i>morphemes</i>; i.e. root of a word, prefix or a suffix. E.g. frost is a morpheme and has a specific meaning and defrost now consists of two morphemes; de- and frost. Each morpheme consists of one or more <i>phonemes</i>. Phonemes are the sounds of speech.
</p>

<p>
Certain damage to specific areas of the brain results in deficits in language comprehension and production; this is called <b>aphasia</b>. P Broca has examined the brain of someone who could only say the word <i>tan</i>, and concluded that an area in the left frontal lobe is responsible for the production of speech and now it's called Broca's area. A damage to this area causes <i>expressive aphasia</i> or aka <i>Broca' aphasia</i>. This patient could comprehend what's spoken to him, but wouldn't be able to produce a response; words _Wernicke's aphasia on the other hand, causes deficits in comprehending language; people could speak fluently, with nonsensical words, but not understand what's said to them. This happens due to damage in the left hemisphere where temporal and parietal lobes meet.
</p>

<p>
New born babies can be reinforced to learn language, however, most parents don't apply reinforcement operants. Babies learn language by making patterns and making new sentences based on these pattern. E.g. a 3y old baby could say <i>knowed</i> instead of <i>knew</i> because he'd perceived that making a verb past tense works by adding <i>ed</i> to the end of a word; this doesn't necessarily mean they'd hear it in their environment.
</p>

<p>
Children go through different phases while learning a language: - cooing - babbling - telegraphic speech - making sentences of two words or more
</p>

<p>
&gt; Chomsky claimed that humans were born with a <i>language acquisition device</i>; which contains universal grammars. This hypothesis enables humans into coming to new world prepared to learn a language which then differs by culture
</p>

<p>
&gt; Language does not need vision or sound to be learned; e.g. deaf babies exposed to sign language can learn and communicate just as normal kids.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reading</i> is as easy as speaking and is effortless for most people. Our ability to automatically read grouped letters, i.e. words, derives meanings for us. But it also interferes when are asked to name the color the word is painted in, aka Stroop Effect; read <i>red</i> while it's painted in blue!
</p>

<p>
Reading is taught mostly in two techniques: <i>phonics</i> or <i>whole language</i>. Phonics dictates that children should learn a language by learning morphemes and phonemes. While Whole language is about understanding the meaning of words or sentences.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Dyslexia is a reading disorder in which a learner has difficulties identifying which symbols are letters and which letters compose words!
</p>

<h3>Intelligence</h3>

<br>

<p>
Intelligence is the ability to learn faster, reason, solve problem and think. And to adapt to environmental challenges.
</p>

<p>
Intelligence tests: - high reliability: measuring intelligence for a certain person, the output should be consistent. - high predictive validity(but depends on the complexity of someone's job):
</p>

<p>
<i>General Intelligence(g)</i> the idea is that one general factor underlies intelligence; is when a certain person possesses particular knowledge which in turn helps them to excel at other fields.
</p>

<p>
<i>Differential psychology</i>:
</p>

<p>
g has two types: - Fluid intelligence: without previous knowledge. The ability to think fast, solve problems, or reason in a given time frame; it also relates to the reaction time which has great impact on our lives. &gt; E.g. solving crossword puzzle or understanding the meaning of a sentence
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Crystallized intelligence: the wide and accumulated knowledge</li>
</ul>
&gt; E.g. identify a verb, adjective or an adverb in a sentence.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Environment has a great influence on intelligence. Living circumstances, schools, friends or nutrition
</p>

<p>
&gt; There's no basis-cut evidence that genes influence intelligence, and it's scientifically not accurate to say so, since there's another factor, namely environment.
