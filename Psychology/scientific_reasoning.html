an idea sounds plausible, it's not necessary scientific.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fixation of belief</i> an attitude of some person toward a particular claim e.g. - i believe that lik attracts like as stated in LoA - i believe in time dilation.
</p>

<p>
A claim can be true or false; when it aligns with reality.
</p>

<p>
&gt; believing that a given claim is true doesn't provide info about the truth or falsity of the claim itself.
</p>

<p>
How to provide possibilities that a claim scientifically justified or not? By different scientifically methods
</p>

<p>
Why the claim of einstein is justified and the one of intelligent aliens exist is not?
</p>

<p>
&gt; Although the one of einstein seems not understandable as the one of the intelligent aliens?
</p>

<p>
Einstein's is based on scientific method while the other isn't
</p>

<p>
Methods to fixate belief:
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>personal experience: e.g you have cold and you take a pill, you may start to believe that that pill helps each time you're sick(cold). However it might not be better; from a scientific perspective
<ul>
<li>e.g. global warming isn't real, i was cold yesterday</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intuition: what you observe or what ppl would tell u</li>
</ul>
&gt; e.g. "catharsis works" - we tend to believe good stories, availability heuristic or confirmation bias
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>e.g. a certain president says he's a natural instinct that global worming isn't real,</li>
</ul>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>authority: e.g. santa claus, the secret or religion!</li>
</ul>
&gt; because of the ppl of authority ppl inclined to believe in what they'd said!
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<li>e.g. this president can be followed by people because of their position</li>
</ul>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Scientific method: combines proper reasoning and systematic empiricism(i.e. use of verifiable evidence based on experience with the world) to reach conclusions!
<ul>
<li>self-correcting: it offers the opportunity that one belief can be compared with another and replaced if it's false!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>Empirical cycle(theory data cycle)</i>: usually scientists use this cycle as a mechanism of certain theory that should be justified steps: - define the theory and know its component - make a prediction on what it dictates - compare or integrate real-world data with the prediction - then you can induce whether the data agree with real values of the theory; reality - inductive reasoning: applying a general rule based on specific observations. - this conclusion is often plausible, but not inescapable(might not be true)
</p>

<p>
&gt; Hypothesis is referred to by Donk as a <i>theory</i>; while in the book is the principles of a theory
</p>

<p>
<i>what is science</i>
</p>

<p>
conditional claim: include a conditional claim to reach to a conclusion; e.g. if you study, u pass the exam
</p>

<p>
conditional argument: when you deny the consequence; e.g. if i eat too much, my stomach hurt. I don't eat too much, my stomach wont hurt me if A then B not B thus not A(valid)
</p>

<p>
Q: is the same as saying: i have a stomachache, because i ate too much. I didn't eat too much, then i don't have any pain?!!!!
</p>

<p>
if A then B B ths A(invalid)
</p>

<p>
if A then B not A, thus not B(invalid)
</p>

<p>
&gt; to justify a hypothesis, it needs to be the conclusion of a valid argument! e.g. - theory - theory of relativity - hypothesis(H) - time dilation exists - initial conditions(IC)
</p>

<pre>
&gt; an experiment has been made, with atomic clocks in airplanes and on earth. Assumption: time registration is reliable. 
</pre>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>auxiliary assumptions(AA)
<ul>
<li>registration reliable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
-&gt; - prediction: if the previous steps were true, then the prediction should be true. &gt; it turned out to be true,
</p>

<p>
if [H and IC and AA] then p p thus [H and IC and AA] (invalid)
</p>

<p>
this is an invalid argument; see above conditional argumetn!
</p>

<p>
If [H and IC and AA] then P if [not-H and IC and AA] then probably not-p
</p>

<p>
<i>Logic behind science</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>SCientific reasoning</i> - justifying a theoretical hypothesis if [not-H and IC and AA] then probably not-p P thus: not [not-H and IC and AA] == H or not-IC or not-AA == IC and AA
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>refuting a theoretical hypothesis;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>Falsifiability</i> ppl believe statements which - can be demonstrated to be false - can be demonstrated to be most likely true.
</p>

<p>
&gt; if [not-H and IC and AA] then probably not P - cannot be demonstrated to be false or true(not scientific)
</p>

<p>
TO find agood justification for the believe that hypothesis is true, the hypothesis needs to be potentially falsifiable
</p>

<p>
&gt; e.g. theory predicts what breakfast you had based on facial expression: you had bread and butter! is it impressive? No, it doesn't justify .. suppose now, the prediction was more specific(chocolate with milk!), u would be more interested, because there are many other different types of food you could have eaten! (this specific prediction is falsified; so more impressive!)
</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>it's impossible to falsify the Secret; cuz part of the theory, that they'd say a person might not have generated the proper thoughts needed</li>
<li>Evolution theory: some of the predictions:
<ul>
<li>the earth should be at least hundreds of million years old</li>
<li>precambrian fossils: it turned out to be true</li>
<li>bacterial resistance against penicillin: bacterial evolve to become resistance; it happened. 80ys after the intro of evolution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INtelligent design theory: a belief that's based on faith; even it was presented by scientist and in a scientific manner. But his theory doesn't generate any predictions so it's not falsifiable!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A theory is supported by scientific testing, is a scientific one; not like intelligent design(not falsifiable)
